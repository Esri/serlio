# ![](doc/img/serlio_32.png)  Serlio - CityEngine Plugin for Autodesk Maya

Serlio is a plugin for [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/maya). It provides a modifier node which enables the execution of [CityEngine](https://www.esri.com/software/cityengine) ‘rules’ within a Maya scene. Therefore, a 3D environment artist does not have to leave their familiar Maya toolset anymore to make use of CityEngine’s procedural modeling power. Complicated export-import pipelines are no longer needed, which also means that the procedural building models do not need to be “baked” in future. The buildings stay procedural during the entire modeling workflow. Consequently, the 3D environment artist can change many attributes, for example the height, style and appearance of buildings can be altered easily with a parametric interface at any point during production.

Serlio requires so-called rule packages (RPK) as input, which are authored in CityEngine. An RPK includes assets and a CGA rule file which encodes an architectural style. Comprehensive RPK examples are available below and can be used “out-of-the-box” in Serlio.

Serlio is well suited for managing the procedural generation of architectural 3D content in digital sets. However, Serlio is restricted to the procedural generation of singular objects - particularly buildings. Serlio does not include the city layouting and street network editing tools of CityEngine i.e. the rich CityEngine toolset to design a city from scratch (or based on geographic data) is still needed.




## Quick Start
1. Install Serlio by downloading the latest [installer](https://github.com/Esri/serlio/releases/latest). Please see [below](#linux-2) for installation on Linux.
1. Start Maya, a new `Serlio` menu item will appear.
1. In Maya, select a mesh and use the `Serlio` menu to assign a rule package (RPK), for example [this one](/doc/data/extrude.rpk) which creates a simple extrusion based on a "height" parameter. You can [author your own RPKs with CityEngine](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/help/help-rule-package.htm).
1. Make sure the geometry is still selected and go to the `serlio` tab in the Attribute editor. Here you can edit the rule parameters.

   1. [Export your own rule file from CityEngine](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/help/help-rule-package.htm).
1. The selected rule will be applied to the mesh. It depends on the rule how multiple faces are handled.

#### Remove rule files
1. Select the generated model(s).
1. Go to the `Serlio` menu and select "Remove CityEngine Rule Package".
1. Only the initial shape mesh with default materials remains.

#### Creating materials
Currently we only support one material type per mesh (see [known limitations](#known-limitations)).

##### Viewport (Stingray) materials
1. Select the generated model(s).
1. Go to the `Serlio` menu and select "Create Materials".
1. The materials for all selected models will be generated and displayed in the viewport.

##### Arnold materials
1. Select the generated model(s).
1. Go to the `Serlio` menu and select "Create Arnold Materials".
1. The Arnold materials for all selected models will be generated.
1. Add a light source from "Arnold" > "Lights".
1. In order to see the rendered view either:
   * Render the current frame once: "Arnold" > "Render" or
   * Switch the renderer in the Viewport to "Arnold" and hit the start button.

#### Working with Attributes in the inspector
1. Select a generated model in the Viewport or the Outliner.
1. Go to the `Serlio` tab in Attribute Editor.
1. Change the rule, seed and rule attributes in the Attribute Editor.
1. The model will update according to the new attribute values.
1. Use the arrow on the right of an attribute to reset the attribute to its default value. The default value might depend on the seed and/or other attributes.

## Known Limitations

* Serlio 2.2 and Maya 2023 **on Linux**: Serlio does not work if the Maya 2023 USD plugin is active at the same time (USD library clash).
* Serlio 2.0: In Maya 2019 on Windows, Serlio does not support reading USD assets from RPKs.
* Modifying the input shape after a Serlio node is attached is not supported.
* Scaling transformations on the initial shape mesh will scale the entire generated model. Make sure that all scaling transformations on the initial shape mesh are frozen before applying a rule ("Modify" > "Freeze Transformations").
* Maya uses centimeters as default working units, we recommend changing these to meters in
  "Windows" > "Settings/Preferences" > "Preferences" > "Settings" > "Working Units".
   * We also recommend multiplying the value of the "Near Clip Plane" and "Far Clip Plane" attributes  in the `perspShape` of the perspective camera by a factor of 100.
* Duplicating a generated Serlio building multiple times with copy/paste can lead to wrong materials due to a naming bug in Maya. However, there are two workarounds: 
   1. Use smart duplicate instead: Go to "Edit" > "Duplicate Special" and tick "Assign unique name to children nodes".
   1. Manually rename all pasted meshes to something unique and regenerate the rule.
